With spatial and spectral resolution of  , Hyper-Skin offers an extensive collection of hyperspectral cubes, providing over a million spectra per image. A notable feature of Hyper-Skin is the inclusion of synthesized RGB images generated from 28 real camera response functions, enabling versatile experimental setups. What sets Hyper-Skin apart is its comprehensive spectral coverage, including both the visible (VIS) spectrum spanning from   to   and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum from   to  , facilitating a holistic understanding of various aspects of human facial skin, enabling new possibilities for consumer applications to see beyond the visual appearance of their selfies and gain valuable insights into their skin's physiological characteristics, such as melanin and hemoglobin concentrations. With Hyper-Skin dataset, we aim to facilitate ongoing research in facial skin-spectra reconstruction on consumer devices, bringing affordable hyperspectral skin analysis directly to the consumer's fingertips.</p>"}]}
